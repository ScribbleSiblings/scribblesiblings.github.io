<p>The Leviathan doesn't use the Shelter's ability on the first 4 nights. They cannot on the 5th, as it is the final night.</p>
</div>
<h3>How to Run</h3>
<div class="how-to-run">
<p>Each night, if the Shelter is not marked "No Ability", when the Demon wakes, show the Shelter's token, and get them to nod or shake their head. If they nod, mark them "Safety" and mark the Shelter "No Ability".<br>If the Demon is executed and is marked "Safety", a Minion becomes the Demon - mark them "Is the Demon", and wake them that night to show them "You are" followed by the Demon's token.<br>At dusk, remove the "Safety" marker.</p>
